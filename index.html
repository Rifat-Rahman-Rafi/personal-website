   <p>A junior web developer works with a team of developers to create new websites and applications. The junior designation means you work under the supervision of senior developers in your department, but you may be involved in all stages of the project, from brainstorming to final testing. As a junior web developer, you meet with clients to review web design needs and preferences and provide advice on website maintenance. While working on the project, you need to make sure to follow company protocols, federal regulations, and user needs. After working in the industry for several years, you may choose to seek senior developer positions.</p>

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
